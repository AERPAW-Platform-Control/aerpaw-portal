    <h5>Canonical Experiments</h5>
    <hr>
    <div class="mb-3">
      In AERPAW, we consider the "canonical" Experiment to be one in which the target resources are AERPAW's AFRNs, APRNs, and programmable vehicles (UAVs, UGVs), and the Experimenter writes code to program the UAV trajectories, and the SDR transmissions, to realize their experimental intent.  We also call this the “Program-it-Yourself” (PiY) approach to initiating an experiment. This is the most common experiment type.
